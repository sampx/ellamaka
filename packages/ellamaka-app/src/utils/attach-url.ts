/**
 * Build the URL that the server-side TUI attach subprocess uses to reach its
 * own server. The attach process is spawned by the server on the same machine,
 * so the host is always loopback — the client-facing hostname the workbench was
 * opened with (e.g. `http://ellamac:4096`) may not resolve on the server itself.
 * The port is preserved so each server attaches to its own listener.
 *
 * Throws on missing or malformed input: `sdk.url` is a required field, and a
 * bad value must surface as a visible error (the caller falls back to chat)
 * instead of silently targeting a guessed host.
