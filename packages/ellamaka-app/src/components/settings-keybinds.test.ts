/**
 * The `showFileTree` setting and its `fileTree.toggle` command were removed
 * entirely (commit 54b9d14d7d): the sidebar file tree is a first-class nav
 * view with no master switch. The keybind settings list kept a leftover row
 * whose i18n key was deleted, rendering a blank entry with an "Unassigned"
 * badge. This regression guards the settings surface against reintroducing
 * the legacy wiring.
